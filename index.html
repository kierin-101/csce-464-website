      Hi, I'm Kierin. I'm in my junior year at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and I'm an SE major. For Senior
      Design, I work with Henderson State Bank to create a web application that allows users to edit, view, and create
      loans. I'm also a TA for CSCE 231, and I previously worked on the FOSS app Pitivi last year for SOFT 261. This
      summer, I'm going to be interning for a local company, though I'm not sure what I'll be doing yet. I'm excited to
      see where my career takes me!

        Pitivi is a free and open-source video editor for Linux. It is written in Python and uses the GStreamer
        multimedia framework. My team "contributed" (the changes were never submitted in a merge request) a new feature
        that allowed the user to essentially bookmark points in their video timeline, give the bookmakrs names, do
        things like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        (It was kinda boring, but it was a good learning experience. I learned a lot about the Git workflow and how to
        work with a team of developers. I learned a lot about the GStreamer framework and how to work with it. I also
        <i>also</i> learned that I don't like working with GStreamer.)

        The Agricultural Input Origination Software (long name, blame the client)
        is a web application that allows users from Henderson State Bank and their customers to edit,
        view, and create loans. I mainly work on the front-end of the application, using ReactJS
        and TypeScript to create a User Interface for the application.
        (The reason I work on the front-end is because I'm scared of the back-end. I don't like working with databases.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I would say more about working with Henderson, but I have no idea what I'm allowed to say.
        I don't want to get in trouble for accidentally leaking sensitive information, so I'll just leave it at that.

      Here are some of the courses I've taken that I think are relevant to my major and my career goals:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>CSCE 231</b>: Programming at the Hardware/Software Interface
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>CSCE 411</b>: Database Systems
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>SOFT 468</b>: Requirements Engineering
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>

  <span id="ta_experience">
    <h1>Teaching Assistant Experience</h1>
  </span>
  <div class="ta_content">
    <p>
      I have been a TA for CSCE 231 for the past two semesters. I hold office hours in the dungeon that is Avery 12 and
      lead 2 lab
      sections a week, helping students with lab, introducing them to new concepts, things like that. I also
      help students off the clock over Discord via the 231 server.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to one of the students, I'm "the GOAT TA." I guess that means I'm doing something right. I'm not sure.

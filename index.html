    <p>
      Hi, I'm Kierin. I'm a student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and I'm an SE major. In my free time, I enjoy
      writing, playing video games, and watching anime/cartoons. My favorite video game is probably <i>Baldur's Gate
        III</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not doing any of those things, I'm probably working on a project or doing homework. I'm also a TA for
      CSCE 231, so that also takes up a lot of my time. (You can read more about that in the "Teaching Assistant
      Experience" section.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of Senior Design, I'm working with Henderson State Bank to create a web application that allows users to
      view and edit loans. (You can read more about that in the "Projects I've Worked On" section.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a whimsical unicorn to brighten your day. I hope you enjoy your stay on my website!

        Pitivi is a free and open-source video editor for Linux. It is written in Python and uses the GStreamer
        multimedia framework. My team "contributed" (the changes were never submitted in a merge request) a new feature
        that allowed the user to essentially bookmark points in their video timeline, give the bookmakrs names, do
        things like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        (It was kinda boring, but it was a good learning experience. I learned a lot about the Git workflow and how to
        work with a team of developers. I learned a lot about the GStreamer framework and how to work with it. I also
        <i>also</i> learned that I don't like working with GStreamer.)

        background.)

        The Agricultural Input Origination Software (long name, blame the client)
        is a web application that allows users from Henderson State Bank and their customers to edit,
        view, and create loans. I mainly work on the front-end of the application, using ReactJS
        and TypeScript to create a User Interface for the application.
        (The reason I work on the front-end is because I'm scared of the back-end. I don't like working with databases.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I would say more about working with Henderson, but I have no idea what I'm allowed to say.
        I don't want to get in trouble for accidentally leaking sensitive information, so I'll just leave it at that.

      Here are some of the courses I've taken that I think are relevant to my major and my career goals:

    <p>
      I have been a TA for CSCE 231 for the past two semesters. I hold office hours in the dungeon that is Avery 12 and
      lead 2 lab
      sections a week, helping students with lab, introducing them to new concepts, things like that. I also
      help students off the clock over Discord via the 231 server.
